# Employees Absenteeism Dashboard

This Project was carried out as part of the requirements to complete the Data Science Programme at Explore AI Academy.

A manager at a medium-sized company has noticed a drop in performance from the  team. 
The causes were investigated and it was found out that absenteeism is quite a problem. There is a need to determine how to 
help those who are missing work. 
Human Resources Absenteeism dataset was provided and I was required to use this 
dataset to build a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will then be used to gather insights and
answer questions regarding employee absenteeism.

The dataset was cleaned and wrangled on Power BI using DAX and the Dashboard was equally created.

# Employees Absenteeism Dashboard

This Project was carried out as part of the requirements to complete the Data Science Programme at Explore AI Academy.


A manager at a medium-sized company has noticed a drop in performance from the  team. 
The causes were investigated and it was found out that absenteeism is quite a problem. There is a need to determine how to 
help those who are missing work. 
Human Resources Absenteeism dataset was provided and I was required to use this 
dataset to build a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will then be used to gather insights and
answer questions regarding employee absenteeism.


The dataset was cleaned and wrangled on Power BI using DAX and the Dashboard was equally created.

The dataset contains two tables, the Employee_info table, and the Absenteeism table.

The description of the respective tables is as given below:

**Employee_info:**

● **ID:** Unique identifier for each employee.
● **Transportation expense:** Transportation cost (in USD). 
● **Distance from residence to work:** The distance from the place of work and the employee’s place of residence (kilometers).
● **Age:** Age of the employee (years).
● **Education:** High school (1), graduate (2), postgraduate (3), master and doctorate (4).
● **Children:** Number of child dependents.

In the Absenteeism table:
● **Month** based on Month of absence;
● **Season** based on Month of absence;
● **Absenteeism** reason based on Reason for absence;
● **Disciplinary** status based on Disciplinary failure; and
● **Weekday** based on Day of the Week.


In the Employee_info table:
● **BMI** based on Weight and Height;
● **Drinker status** based on Social drinker;
● **Smoker status** based on Social smoker; and
● **Education** level based on Education.
